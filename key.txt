In one of the ships, the aliens wore Versaces that weren't quite big enough to
cover their extraterrestrial eyes. Each craft had a steering wheel, a windshield 
frame, and a rearview mirror with fuzzy dice. Someone had managed to sneak a
cigarette between the fingers of one alien, and a can of Bud Light into the grip of
another. Perhaps the administration let it go since it was only light beer.
